# Item Stats

Items, consisting of armor, weapons, and other trinkets, compose a character's offensive and  defensive rating.

Example of low level items:

### Simple Dagger
  - Classification: Dagger
  - Type: Piercing
  - DMG: 8-10
  - Affixes: none

### Leather Tunic
  - Classification: Chest Armor
  - Type: Light
  - DEF: 6
  - Affixes: none

Daggers deal <b>Piercing</b> DMG, which deals bonus DMG to <b>Light</b> armor. A defense rating of 6 will reduce the dagger DMG output from 8-10 to 2-4, which is then multiplied by the attack modifer. Weapons that have an advantage against certain armor types will deal an additional 25% DMG, meaning the dagger output will hit from 2.25 to 5 (rounded up). This damage is further multiplied by the characters primary stat rating. EG, a Page with 10 agility will deal an additional 1.5 DMG, for a range of 3.75 to 6.5.
