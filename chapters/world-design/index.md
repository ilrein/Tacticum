# World Design

Tacticum's gameplay is driven by combat, and it's corollary: item & character progression.
Character enhancements lead the door to new techniques, and more powerful combinations.

### PvP

Replayability is the golden standard for any game. How much value is there in replaying it?
Tacticum provides competitive endgame to create replayability. Players can leverage their highly leveled and geared characters to engage in PvP for the ultimate test of skill.

A point based system could also be leveraged, whereas things like items could have a point value,
alongside characters multiplied by a formula relative to their level, and the sum total of points
would determine the total -- this total could be used to find PvP opponents long before the super
late end game.

### PvE

Farming NPC's for gear and experience is a staple of RPGs. Tacticum's concept is that the party
is boarded on some type of ship, an unattached vessel which can navigate to different areas for varied levels of risk/reward. The ship can progressively be enhanced as well, potentially adding things like a bioroom, weight room, classroom, etc.
